This is sort of a follow-up to my \"Ladies of the Tiger\" but with more colour and less metaphor. It's also a reimagining of their fancy clothes.

Nahiro {yellow} Looking away, above others, not caught between drama that is Kinrou+Sahiren; he's pretty quiet so I did a mime-like outfit for him.
Sahiren {red} Above Kinrou (rank), looking splendid, note how Sword is more ornamental, and using it that outfit would be pretty mad.
Kinrou {blue} Below Sahiren (rank), I hope you don't mind the emo haircut; blue fire worked with the colour code, so yeah.
Nalshen {green} Happily ignoring any sort of tension in the room, uh, has nice hair?
...
Why is Sahiren unusually smiling? Find out!

I gave her some different coloured hair highlights as that was a thing in the 80s and accidentally made it come out kind of Twilight Sparkle-ish. Whups.
